# php-rlogger [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hnw/php-rlogger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hnw/php-rlogger)

A PHP extension for rlogd (see: https://github.com/pandax381/rlogd )

# Requirement

- PHP 5.3.x - 7.2.x
- [rlogd](https://github.com/pandax381/rlogd)

# Installation

First of all, prepare `librlog.a` from rlogd package.

```
sudo apt-get install libev-dev libpcre3-dev
git clone https://github.com/pandax381/rlogd.git rlogd
cd rlogd
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
cd ..
```

Now build and install php-rlogger.

```
git clone https://github.com/hnw/php-rlogger.git
cd php-rlogger
phpize
./configure --with-rlogd-src-dir=../rlogd/
make
make install
```

Then edit your `php.ini`.

```
extension=rlogger.so
```

# Usage

## Rlogger::__construct()

Open socket for logging.

```
int Rlogger::__construct([string address, [int timeout]])
```

Specify `address` for rloggerd listening address.

## Rlogger::write()

Write message with tag.

```
int Rlogger::write(string tag, string str)
```

## Rlogger::close()

Close socket.

```
void Rlogger::close()
```

Note: All open sockets would be closed in object destructor. So, it is not necessary to call `close()` explicitly.

## Ini settings

### rlogger.address

Specify default address for `Rlogger::__construct()` (default: `"unix:///var/run/rlogd/rloggerd.sock"` )

### rlogger.timeout

Specify default timeout msec for `Rlogger::__construct()` (default: 3000)


## Example

```php
<?php
$rlogger = new Rlogger();
$rlogger->write("example.acc", "Normal log messages");
try {
    // Critical operations...
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $rlogger->write("example.err", $e->getMessage());
    throw $e;
}
```
